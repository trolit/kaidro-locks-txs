Tool to analyse [Ronin](https://roninchain.com/) EVM blockchain wallet's transactions, related to Kaidro locks transactions (either via RON or A-KDR) before TGE. This should only be used as reference and not hard evidence as the terms of A-KDR conversion might be changed.

Notes:

- due to limited REST API features for non-API key owners, RON purchases data was extracted to `.csv` file and then converted to `.json`.
- Skynet REST API is set to be deprecated on 31/12/2024 ([link](https://docs.skymavis.com/api/ronin-rest/skynet-rest-api))
- A-KDR to KDR conversion rules ([link](https://kaidro-chronicle.gitbook.io/kaidrowhitepaper/kaidro-p2a/alpha-usdkdr))
- json properties were slightly modified
- RON transactions data range is between 01.07.2024 - 14.12.2024
